# Risks-and-returns-Sharpe-Ratio-Datacamp

This was a Datacamp guided project.

I learned about the history behind the Sharpe Ratio and the role it fulfills in comparing two investment opportunities with similar returns.

Here, I figured out how to compute it from scratch by :
1. Importing and cleaning the necessary financial data,
2. Computing and graphing a necessary comparison metric : financial returns.
3. Calculating and graphing the Sharpe ratio, our metric of interest.
